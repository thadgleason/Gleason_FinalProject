# VOR_Planner
This program will be used to plan flights using VORs.
The VORs will be set up as a graph. Using this graph one can select a starting city and an ending city from a list and the program will calculate the total distance of the flight. Using a linked list, each leg can be broken down as well. The user can input data such as cruise velocity, fuel flow rate, and fuel price and the program can calculate travel time and cost for the trip and for each leg of the trip. This individual analysis would be used for trips where the pilot would need to stop for fuel, for example.
