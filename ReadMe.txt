This program can be used to find the shortest IFR VOR route to local airports. It allows you to select a starting airport and an ending airport. After the route has been found, there are a few options: calculate the time of flight, calculate the amount of fuel used, calculate the cost of the flight, or simply print out the VOR routes and distances. 

When the program is run, the list of airports is displayed. Enter the number that corresponds with your starting airport. Next enter the number that corresponds to the destination airport. The program now does its work and builds a linked list of the path. The options are then displayed.

1. Calculate time of travel. Simply enter your cruise velocity (in knots) and the program will calculate and estimate of the time required. 
2. Calculate fuel used. First enter your fuel flow rate (in gallons per hour), then your cruise velocity (in knots), and the program will calculate how much fuel you are using.
3. Calculate fuel costs. First enter your fuel flow rate (in gallons per hour), then your price of fuel (in dollars), last your cruise velocity (in knots), then the cost of your flight will be calculated.
4. Print directions. Nothing to enter here. Each leg will be displayed with the VOR route and distance to the next airport.
5. End the program

Some of the airports aren't ideal for this method of planning. For example, Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport only has a VOR that connects to Colorado Springs. So in order to go anywhere one must fly to Colorado Springs first when in reality one could easily find a VOR from Denver and fly those paths.
